To equip students with best of technical knowledge we have screened mentors from esteemed organizations and successful start-ups like Microsoft, Accenture, Amazon, etc. Our tech training exposes students to various tools, assignments and hands on live projects. Since we have freelance trainers who are still working with organizations, students receive most updated domain skills from these mentors. During their training students are encouraged to build their profile on Github, stack flow etc. All these combined increases chances of student’s employability to manifold. <br/><br/>

Our training programs focus on the holistic development of students and hence we also train students on attitudinal and behavioral aspects which helps them not only clear HR part of their interview but also helps them in their long-term corporate career. For this training, we have trainers from acclaimed institutions like IIM’s. Profile and other details can be checked from attached PPT.<br/><br/>
